# BHT Bot Service Framework

## Purpose

This library is meant to kickstart new BHT-Bot Service Applications (and reduce redundancy ofc)

You can setup a new Service in just a few lines of code. All you have to care about is the implementation of your specific Service Implementations, while Service Communication and Types are offered by the framework.

The framework contains CommonJS and ES-Modules bundles.
